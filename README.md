## Overview
  This course will equip you with the key concepts & skills you’ll need to become proficient with the TypeScript language, and acquaint you with the production-grade tooling, workflows, and resources you’ll want to accelerate your productivity and career growth.


By taking this course, you'll:
  - Understand how TypeScript differs from JavaScript, and the advantages TS offers
  - Install & configure TS in a new or existing codebase
  - Add type annotations to variables, function arguments & return values
  - Work with custom types & interfaces, including complex types, unions & generics
  - Get acquainted with popular libraries from the open-source TS ecosystem
  - Set up your professional workflow for full-stack TS development

## What's this course all about? 
  TypeScript is the industry’s preferred way to bring some order to the notorious unpredictability of JavaScript’s weak typing, allowing us to write more stable, production-ready web apps. In this course, we’ll get to know TypeScript through hands-on refactoring exercises, as we use increasingly complex TS features to stabilize a buggy JS app. Beyond exploring the language itself, we’ll also get familiar with popular TS tooling and workflows for full-stack development. By the end of the course, you’ll be a productive TypeScript developer ready to deepen your knowledge with further courses on FrontendMasters.

## Who is this course for?

- Are you comfortable with JavaScript, and looking to add TypeScript to your pro web developer skillset?
- Are you a JS developer who’s sick of encountering silly errors like misspelled method names or un-awaited Promises, and ready to invest in making your apps more reliable?
- Have you tried working with or learning TypeScript before, but found it overwhelming and frustrating?
- Did you learn some TS in the past, and want to review the fundamentals and learn practical tools & workflows for TS development?
	
If any or all of those are true, this is the perfect course for you!
